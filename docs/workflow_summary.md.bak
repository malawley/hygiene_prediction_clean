# ‚úÖ Cloud Run Deployment Workflow for a Containerized Microservice System

This document outlines the full end-to-end process for developing, containerizing, configuring, and deploying a microservice-based system on **Google Cloud Run**, using **Artifact Registry** for image storage. It includes executive-level summaries, detailed steps, and a troubleshooting appendix.

---

## üåê Executive Overview

Containerized microservices must be adapted for the cloud environment in order to operate as a cohesive, scalable system. Google Cloud Run provides a managed compute platform that abstracts away infrastructure concerns. Each microservice becomes an independent web service with a dedicated HTTPS endpoint. To coordinate communication, configuration must be externalized, authentication scoped correctly, and communication links reestablished with secure URLs.

The deployment workflow therefore includes: local development and testing, cloud container registry setup, container image tagging and push, Cloud Run service creation, environment variable configuration for secure inter-service communication, and IAM permission setup.

## üöß Step-by-Step Workflow

### **1. Develop and Test Locally**

- Build each service (e.g., extractor, cleaner, dashboard) as a **Docker container**.
- Use **Docker Compose** to simulate the full system locally.
- Test all endpoints and ensure inter-service URLs use container names (e.g., `http://trigger:8080/clean`).

### **2. Prepare Dockerfiles**

- Each microservice has its own `Dockerfile`.
- Include dependencies, port exposure, entry point (CMD), and environment configuration.
- Use minimal base images (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`, `distroless`) for security.

### **3. Authenticate Docker with Google Cloud**

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

- This writes credential helpers into `~/.docker/config.json`.
- Ensures Docker can push to Artifact Registry.

### **4. Tag Images for Artifact Registry**

```bash
docker tag local_image_name us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY_NAME/IMAGE_NAME
```

Example:
```bash
docker tag hygiene_prediction-trigger us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/hygiene-prediction/containers/trigger
```

### **5. Push Images to Artifact Registry**

```bash
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/hygiene-prediction/containers/trigger
```

- Repeat for all images.
- Validate with `gcloud artifacts repositories list` and `gcloud auth list`.

### **6. Deploy to Cloud Run**

```bash
gcloud run deploy SERVICE_NAME \
  --image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE_NAME \
  --platform=managed \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

Example:
```bash
gcloud run deploy trigger \
  --image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/hygiene-prediction/containers/trigger \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

- Configure additional settings like memory, CPU, concurrency, environment variables.

### **7. Configure Inter-Service Communication**

#### Executive Summary:
Cloud Run assigns each service its own **HTTPS URL**. These URLs must be shared among services for communication. Environment variables or config files (e.g., `services.json`) are updated with Cloud Run endpoints. Communication is secured via HTTPS.

**Example configuration:**
```json
{
  "trigger": { "url": "https://trigger-abc123.run.app" },
  "cleaner": { "url": "https://cleaner-xyz456.run.app" }
}
```

- Replace Docker hostnames with public URLs.
- Use `gcloud run services list` to get the deployed URLs.

### **8. Set IAM Permissions**

- Grant services the correct access:
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding hygiene-prediction \
  --member="user:YOUR_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/artifactregistry.writer"
```

- Grant service accounts roles like:
  - `roles/run.invoker` for calling services
  - `roles/bigquery.user` or `roles/bigquery.jobUser`
  - `roles/storage.objectViewer`

### **9. Monitor and Debug**

- Use Cloud Logging:
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=trigger" --limit=50
```
- Verify network requests, environment variables, and IAM access.

### **10. (Optional) Automate with CI/CD**

- Use Cloud Build or GitHub Actions:
  - Build Docker image
  - Push to Artifact Registry
  - Deploy to Cloud Run

## üß† Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cloud Run** | Deploys stateless containers with HTTPS endpoints |
| **Artifact Registry** | Secure image repository scoped to GCP projects |
| **Service-to-Service** | Configured using full URLs and secure IAM authentication |
| **Environment Variables** | Used to inject endpoint locations, auth settings, or config into containers |
| **IAM Roles** | Allow or restrict container access to BigQuery, Storage, etc. |
| **Monitoring** | Done via `gcloud logging` and Cloud Console for each Cloud Run service |

## üõ† Troubleshooting Appendix

### ‚ùå `403 Forbidden` on `docker push`
**Cause:** Docker not authenticated.
**Fix:**
```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```
Ensure proper IAM permissions: `roles/artifactregistry.writer`

### ‚ùå `Failed to decode JSON` in Go service
**Cause:** Go expects string fields, but numbers are passed.
**Fix:** Ensure payload values are strings. Use `fmt.Sprintf("%d", number)` when marshaling in Go.

### ‚ùå Cannot access `/logs` directory in container
**Cause:** Volume mount conflict or missing `MkdirAll()` in Go.
**Fix:** Ensure `os.MkdirAll("/logs", 0755)` and volume is mounted in Docker Compose and Cloud Run.

### ‚ùå Duplicate events triggered twice
**Cause:** Service retry logic or parallel triggers.
**Fix:** Implement deduplication tracking (e.g., in-memory or DB) inside the trigger service.

### ‚ùå BigQuery fails in Cloud Run
**Cause:** Service account lacks permission.
**Fix:** Assign `roles/bigquery.user` or `roles/bigquery.jobUser` to the Cloud Run service account.

### ‚ùå Streamlit UI error: `Permission denied: credentials file`  
**Cause:** Service account file not mounted.
**Fix:** Add `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var and mount `.json` key file in Docker or Cloud Run deployment.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts
This reference guide captures all key operational steps required to containerize, configure, deploy, and connect a multi-service system using Google Cloud Run. Keep it updated with lessons learned from production deployment. Also consider moving towards automated CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code for long-term scalability.
